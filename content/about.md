| This annual FRC off-season event has been hosted by a number of FRC teams and FIRST organizations in the St. Louis area since its inception in 2014. We've been fortunate to have the support of many gracious hosts, from Hazelwood Central High School to Lindenwood University and now Oakville High School. | Our mission for this event is to provide one last opportunity for returning FRC students to get their last season's robot on an official Andy Mark field to play that season's game! This event also serves as an opportunity for new students to experience a first look at an FRC competition event before the official Competition Season cranks the intensity up to 11. |
